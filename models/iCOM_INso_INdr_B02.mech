% # iCOM_INso_INdr_B02: Simple ohmic axial current for connecting FROM one IN cell
%     dendrite TO the corresponding IN cell axo-soma INso<-INdr_B02 used in the
%     DynaSim implementation of (Bazhenov et al., 2002). Note that in the
%     original code, this cell type is called CX and sometimes IN, while the
%     compartments are called CX_DEND or CX_SOMA.

% Note that, due to the "reduced form" used in the PYso's master equations, it
%     is significantly easier to understand how the system is calculated by
%     doing all of the conversions in the master equation rather than
%     separately in nonstandard methods in the mechanism files. In other words,
%     trust me that this setup, including this handling of the dendritic
%     voltage, is the easiest to understand.
voltageFunction(IN) = IN

@voltage += voltageFunction(IN)
