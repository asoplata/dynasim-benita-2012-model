% # iKCa_INdr_B12: slow calcium-dependent potassium current, for generic
%     interneuron dendrite compartments used in the DynaSim implementation of
%     (Bazhenov et al., 2002). In the original code, this compartment/cell type
%     is called CX, CX_DEND, and sometimes IN, and this current is called
%     IKCa_CX.
%
% - Note: In original code, IKCa consumes y[1] which is `Cai0` for the
%     celltype, and y[1] is also used as the primary state variable `cai` for
%     the Ca buffer ICa. Therefore, IKCa is using the cai of ICa.
