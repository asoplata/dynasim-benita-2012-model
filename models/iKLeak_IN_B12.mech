% # iKLeak_INdr_B12: Potassium Leak current, Hodgkin-Huxley-style, for generic
%     interneuron dendrite compartments used in the DynaSim implementation of
%     (Bazhenov et al., 2002). Note that in the original code, this
%     compartment/cell type is called CX, CX_DEND, and sometimes IN, and this
%     current is defined using `G_kl` and `INaK::E_K`.
