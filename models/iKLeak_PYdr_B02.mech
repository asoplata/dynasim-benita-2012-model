% # iKLeak_PYdr_B02: Potassium Leak current, Hodgkin-Huxley-style, for generic
%     pyramidal dendrite compartments used in the DynaSim implementation of
%     (Bazhenov et al., 2002). Note that in the original code, this
%     compartment/cell type is called CX or CX_DEND, and this current is
%     defined using `G_kl` and `INaK::E_K`.
