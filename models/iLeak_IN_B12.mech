% # iLeak_IN_B12:
%
% Chloride/general Leak current, Hodgkin-Huxley-style, for generic interneuron
% dendrite compartments used in the DynaSim implementation of (Benita et al.,
% 2012). Note that in the original code, this compartment/cell type is called
% CX, CX_DEND, and sometimes IN, and this current is defined using `G_l` and
% `E_l`.
