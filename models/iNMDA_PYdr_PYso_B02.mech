% # iNMDA_PYdr_PYso_B02: Normalized synaptic NMDAergic excitatory current FROM the
%     pyramidal axo-soma TO pyramidal dendrite PYdr<-PYso_B02 connection used in
%     the DynaSim implementation of (Bazhenov et al., 2002). Note that in the
%     original code, the class for this current is called NMDA_D1, PYso_B02 are
%     called CX or CX_SOMA, and PYdr are called CX or CX_DEND. Also note that,
%     instead of using a Heaviside increase in transmitter concentration upon
%     spike detection, we used the (1 + tanh(V/4)) formulation from (Ermentrout
%     & Kopell, 1998) for our spike detector and transmitter concentration
%     model.
%
% - Note: Even though NMDA_D1 contains the code for using synaptic depression,
%     because it is initialized with `Use = 0.0` on "currents.h" line 889, the
%     synaptic depression will never affect the simulation, and therefore does
%     not need to be calculated.

%     "network.cfg" line 32.

% Parameters

gNMDA = 0.006 % mS/cm^2

ENMDA = 0    % mV

Rinf = 0.72

sIC = 0
sNoiseIC = 0

% Note that alpha rate here corresponds to the inverse of the rise  time constant, 1/tauR, and
%        the beta rate here corresponds to the inverse of the decay time constant, 1/tauD
alpha = 1      % ms^-1
beta  = 0.0067 % ms^-1

% Connective radius, aka how many target cells each source cell connects to,
%     from the source's perspective.
radius = 5

% We also need to normalize the conductance in mS/cm^2 by the number of
%     connections each target cell is receiving on average, so that the TOTAL sum
%     of their conductive inputs adds to our overall maximal conductance above.
% AES
% normalizingFactor = min(((2*radius + 1) / (N_post/N_pre)), N_pre)

% Functions
% Remove autapses to the dendrite corresponding to this soma

% Note that what is passed is 2x the radius
netcon = netconNearestNeighbors(2*radius, N_pre, N_post, removeRecurrentBool)
