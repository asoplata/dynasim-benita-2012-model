% # iNaP_PYdr_B12: Persistent sodium current, Hodgkin-Huxley-style, for
%     generic pyramidal dendrite compartments used in the DynaSim
%     implementation of (Bazhenov et al., 2002). Note that in the original
%     code, this compartment/cell type is called CX or CX_DEND, and this
%     current is called INap_CX.

% Parameters
gNaP = 3.5 % mS/cm^2
ENaP = 50  % mV
% The Q10 temperature adjustment values never change over the course of the
%     simulations, so we are setting them to be constant.
% Note that this uses a reference temperature of 22 unlike 23 in most of the
%     other currents.
