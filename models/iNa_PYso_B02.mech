% # iNa_PYso_B02: Fast sodium current for generic pyramidal soma
%     compartments used in the DynaSim implementation of (Bazhenov et al.,
%     2002). Note that in the original code, this compartment/cell type is
%     called CX or CX_SOMA, and this current is called INa_CX.

%     threshold detection was also built from code from the cited source paper,

% Instead of the PYso_B02 axo-somatic compartment calculating the dv/dt the normal
%     way, they solve for just v using the "steady-state" values of the system.
%     This means that we have to calculate different parts of the current/etc.
%     differently:
% Note that the below doesn't contain the voltage of the soma. This is
%     analogous to the corresponding part of `g2_SOMA` in the original code:
curr_Na_PYso_B02(X,mNa,hNa) = phiM*gNa.*mNa.^3.*hNa.*ENa

% Note that the below doesn't contain any voltages. This is
%     analogous to the corresponding part of `g1_SOMA` in the original code:
cond_Na_PYso_B02(X,mNa,hNa) = phiM*gNa.*mNa.^3.*hNa

monitor curr_Na_PYso_B02
monitor cond_Na_PYso_B02

% ODEs and ICs
