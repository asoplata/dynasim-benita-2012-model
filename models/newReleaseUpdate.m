%NEWRELEASEUPDATE - Calculate time until next Mini release
%
% This function is how we calculate new values of the state variable
% `newRelease` for the 'Mini'-type synaptic mechanisms in the DynaSim
% implementations of (Bazhenov et al., 2002) and (Krishnan et al., 2016). This
% is similar to the original code in the Krishnan code "currents.cpp" lines
% 520-524. This needs to be in an external function for simplification of the
% many checks required for this.

% Note that, in the original code, the timeDifference, when utilized to
%     calculate the next "newrelease" value, is effectively never less than
%     70. In other words, unless timeSinceSpike is > 70, we DO NOT CARE what
%     value timeDifference is since it won't be used. This is important, since
%     when timeSinceSpike is small or zero, this causes our `output` to be Inf,
%     divided by zero, or astronomically large, which turns our values into
%     NaNs silently, which completely (and silently) breaks the simulation!
timeDifference = timeSinceSpike + (timeSinceSpike < 70).*70;

% The denominator here corresponds to the `SS` in the original code, in
%     "currents.cpp" line 520.
output = -log(S)./((2.0./(1.0+exp(-timeDifference./miniFreq))-1.0)./250.0);
